# Tri-Base-Line-Follower
Basically to make a line-follower robot was an easy task but to create the line-follower with accurate result and fast response it will take some time, to complete this project we have to take care of the mechanical robotic body, because if there will be any little difference of angle then it would cost us in the coding, after completing the mechanical body of robot, in coding section we have used the Raspberry-PI board and python language for faster execution and faster response. For the motor control there has to be take care of speed of the back two motors because if any motor will rotate faster than other then it'll create error in the line following and our formula will be wrong for that particular path.
